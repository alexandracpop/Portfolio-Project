# Portfolio-Project

This repo was created to showcase the results of my final project for the Professional Certificate in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence course.

## Project Introduction

 I chose to look at predicting movies revenue based on a number of input variables. To increase model accuracy, I used two machine learning techniques:
* Regression Decision Trees
* Multiple Regression

To further improve accuracy I used GridSearch to tune my hyperparameters.

## Dataset Used

The dataset used is The Movies Dataset, a popular dataset on Kaggle for those of us who enjoy applying data & AI methods to fun topics. The dataset  can be found in the 'data' folder. However, for a more in-depth description of the data please follow the link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

## Machine Learning Models Explored

As my outcome variable is numeric (revenue), the first model I chose was the Regression Decision Tree. This is a supervised machine learning model which has strong positive points:
* ease of interpretability - for both the data scientist and a non-technical audience as results can be easily visualised.
* handles non-linear relationships - relationships between features and the output variable can be captured because unlike regression models, decision trees don't assume a straight line between features and output.
* doesn't require feature scaling - this saves time and effort.
* can easily show the most important features in the model.

The second model that I tried was a Multiple Regression model. This again is a supervised machine learning model. Some of the positives of this model are:
* it can handle many input variables 
* it can identify important features - this is because it looks at the importance of each feature on the output variable.
* it is a widely known and understood method - it's a method that stakeholders trust.
