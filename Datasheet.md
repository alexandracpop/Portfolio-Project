# Datasheet Template

As far as you can, complete the model datasheet. If you have got the data from the internet, you may not have all the information you need, but make sure you include all the information you do have. 

## Motivation
The dataset was created for the purpose of analyzing movie data and gaining insights into the movie industry. The dataset was created by the team at GroupLens Research, a research group within the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. The dataset was funded by the National Science Foundation. The dataset contains information about movies between 1874 to 2017.

## Composition
The instances in the dataset represent movies. There are approximately 45,000 instances in the dataset. The dataset contains information about movies such as title, release date, runtime, budget, revenue, and rating. There is some missing data in the dataset.

The dataset does not contain data that might be considered confidential.

## Collection process
The data was acquired from a number of sources, including IMDb and The Movie Database (TMDb). The data collection process involved scraping publicly available data from these sources. The data was collected over a period of several years.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling
The data was preprocessed and cleaned before being made available for download. This involved removing duplicates, removing irrelevant columns, and imputing missing data. The preprocessed data was then labeled according to various attributes such as genre, language, and production company. The raw data was not saved, only the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data was made available for download. However, for the other datasets that can also be used (e.g reviews, cast & crew information, keywords, etc.) , the data is of questionable quality as the processing/cleaning and labelling is not the same as is for the movie_metadata dataset.

## Uses
The dataset could be used for a variety of tasks such as predicting the revenue of a movie, analyzing movie trends over time, and identifying successful genres. The dataset could also be used for research purposes.

There are no known risks or harms associated with the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses.

The dataset should not be used to make any unfair generalizations about specific individuals or groups.

## Distribution
The dataset has already been distributed via Kaggle and is freely available for download. The dataset is subject to a CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication license, which allows for unrestricted use and distribution of the data.

## Maintenance
According to Kaggle, the dataset was last updated 5 years ago.
